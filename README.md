# ðŸ§© LinkedIn Puzzle Solver Extension

*Because LinkedIn's daily puzzles are so brilliantly designed, sometimes you just want to peek at the solution without the brain work.*

## What This Does

This Chrome extension cheats at LinkedIn's fantastic puzzle games by auto-solving them for you. LinkedIn really nailed these puzzles - they're clever, addictive, and beautifully designed. This extension just... removes all the thinking part. ðŸ¤–

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click "Load unpacked" â†’ select the `.output` folder
4. Click on the extension button to open in the side panel
5. Visit LinkedIn puzzles and watch the magic happen âœ¨ (hint: you need to visit each puzzle for the solutions to show up)

## The Moral Dilemma

LinkedIn's puzzle team deserves mad respect - these games are genuinely fun and well-crafted. This extension basically says "thanks for the great puzzles, now let me completely bypass the experience you carefully designed."

Use responsibly! Or don't. We're not LinkedIn's puzzle police. ðŸš”

*Built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and a slight sense of guilt about automating away perfectly good brain exercise.*
